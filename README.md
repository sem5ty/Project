Predicting the win probability of a chasing team during an IPL match involves considering various factors such as the current score, number of overs left , runs scored per over & wickets lost in that over etc.
Statistical models and algorithms can be employed to make such predictions based on historical data.
Several statistical techniques, such as logistic regression, machine learning algorithms like random forest or gradient boosting, and even neural networks, can be utilized to analyze past match data and make predictions about the win probability of a chasing team at any given point in an IPL match.
Additionally, real-time data analytics during the match, such as the run rate required, the current run rate, the fall of wickets, and the performance of key players, can be used to adjust the win probability.
